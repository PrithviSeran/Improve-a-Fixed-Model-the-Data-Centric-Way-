'Improve a Fixed Model the Data-Centric Way!' is a Kaggle competition where you have to alter the dataset 'Dissolved oxygen prediction in river water' to get the lowest RMSE score for a random forest model with an unknown test set. This repo shows the basic data-altering procedures that need to be done to optimize the machine learning model. 

## Please keep in mind that this repo is not the optimal solution for this problem, but merely a starting point in achiveing information rich data. ##
